class BackupMethod:
    """
    BackupMethod is an abstract class that represents a way to backup and
    restore a list of files.

    Daughters of this class can be used by a BackupManager or RestoreManager
    instance. Some methods are meant to be used by BackupManager and others
    by RestoreManager.

    BackupMethod has a factory method "create" to initialize instances.

    Currently, there are 3 BackupMethods implemented:

    CopyBackupMethod
    ----------------
    This method corresponds to a raw (uncompressed) copy of files to a location,
    and (could?) reverse the copy when restoring.

    TarBackupMethod
    ---------------
    This method compresses all files to backup in a .tar archive. When
    restoring, it untars the required parts.

    CustomBackupMethod
    ------------------
    This one use a custom bash scrip/hook "backup_method" to do the
    backup/restore operations. A user can add his own hook inside
    /etc/yunohost/hooks.d/backup_method/
