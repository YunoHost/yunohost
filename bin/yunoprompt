===============================================================================
You should now proceed with YunoHost post-installation. This is where you will
be asked for:
  - the main domain of your server;
  - the username and password for the first admin

You can perform this step:
  - from your web browser, by accessing: https://yunohost.local/ or ${local_ip}
  - or in this terminal by answering 'yes' to the following question

If this is your first time with YunoHost, it is strongly recommended to take
time to read the administator documentation and in particular the sections
'Finalizing your setup' and 'Getting to know YunoHost'. It is available at
the following URL: https://yunohost.org/admindoc
